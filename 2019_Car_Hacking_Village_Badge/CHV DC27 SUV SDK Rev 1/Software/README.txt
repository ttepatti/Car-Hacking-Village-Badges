Thank you for your purchase of our stoplight badge!  To get started with embedded software development,
you will need:

1. A SWD/JTAG adapter that works with MCUXpresso (see below).  I use a Segger adapter (they 
are the best in my opinion).  You can get the EDU version for ~$60 and it is worth every penny
if you will be doing ARM development (and probably other stuff too).  You can get one here:

www.digikey.com and search for "segger edu".  It was $63 at the time of writing this document.

2. An adapter cable (that you can make yourself or we can make for a small fee) that goes from
the 20-pin standard debug header to the header we have on the PCB.  See the document here:
https://www.specsolns.com/using-swd.html

3. The MCUXpresso tool suite from NXP.  You can get it here:  
https://www.nxp.com/design/software/development-software/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools/mcuxpresso-integrated-development-environment-ide:MCUXpresso-IDE

My SDK's come with the NXP-built microcontroller SDK's.  However, there are many more things you can pull into 
these SDK's.  Go to the SDK builder on nxp.com for the specific target and you can roll your own.

4. The SDK files for your badge obtained from www.specsolns.com/defcon
