# SocketCan

[SocketCan](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/can.txt) is a Linux kernel module that exposed the canbus as a network interface. The [Can-Utils](https://github.com/linux-can/can-utils) package allows you to recieve/send/save/replay arbitrary can packets.

The SLCAN driver interface defines a text based protocol in which a tty device can speak CAN.
